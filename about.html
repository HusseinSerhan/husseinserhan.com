<p>I live in Toronto since 2018. I was born and raised in Venezuela. A fun fact about me is that both my parents are inmigrants (Lebanon and Colombia), and both are successful entrepreneurs. This probably defines me more than anything else.</p>

<p>Email: <a href="mailto:husseinserhan3012@gmail.com">husseinserhan3012@gmail.com</a></p>

<p>My main areas of interest:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Financial Technology</b>: Living through the economic collapse of Venezuela, and seeing how the banking collapse of Lebanon affected my family led to an obsession with economics and banking. </li>
      
      <p>Then, discovering how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_V%C3%A9lez">David Velez</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubank">Nubank</a> improved the life of millions of Brazilians I decided to dedicate my life to the creation of financial products. Another fun (and terrifying) fact: I'm the guy Ben refers to when he tells David that he is coaching someone that wants to become like him in 10 years. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23ND-uMh-io">Look for minute 43</a>.</p>
    
    <li><b>Fitness and Sports</b>: During the pandemic I became 'terribly' out of shape, and when I got fired from <a href="https://www.truora.com/en/">Truora</a> in 2022 I used the gym to channel that frustration. I also coach high school soccer at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_La_Salle_College_(Toronto)">De La Salle 'Oaklands'</a>. I played soccer my whole childhood, and thought I was going pro, so coaching has become another great way to build community and channeling my competitive spirit.</li>
    
    <li><b>Podcast</b>: I'm the podcast guy at everyone of my social groups. Fun fact: in 2024, I was on the top 0.05% of listeners in the education section of Spotify (worldwide). I also organized the 10th anniversay meetup of the <a href="https://tim.blog/podcast/">Tim Ferriss Show</a> in Toronto.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Community</h3>

<ul>
    <li>I have been working at <a href="https://chexy.co/">Chexy</a> for the past 6 months and my co-workers have become my community.</li>
    
    <li>I try to attend <a href="https://builder-sundays.myshopify.com/">Builder Sundays</a>every Sunday.</li> 
</ul>
