<p>2024 gave me the chance to live with my younger brother for the first time in almost a decade, and although I am still figuring things out living together led me to lots of self-reflection. Here is the advice I would give my past me.</p>

<p><b>If you're 10–20:</b> Believe it or not. These are great years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn English. You don't use it daily. Your school botches it. You have self-limiting beliefs about your intellectual capacity. True. Still, do everything to improve your English. It will be the most important skill you could learn. </li>
<li>Your environment does not value education. So, you believe that reading, writing, books and ideas are for soft people. You are <i>wrong</i>.</li>
<li>Start journaling daily. Track things until you find the right diet, fitness routine and sleep schedule. </li>
<li>Don't be so tough with your parents. Life in Venezuela is difficult. They have done a great job considering where they started. </li>
<li>Enjoy the time with your brother. You will spend the rest of your life looking for friendships that resemble him. You won't find them. </li>
<li>Aim to read a lot.</li>
<li>If you think something is important but people older than you don't hold it in high regard, there's a reasonable chance that you're right and they're wrong. Status lags by a generation or more.</li>
<li>Above all else, don't make the mistake of judging your success based on your current peer group. By all means make friends but being weird as a teenager is generally good.
</li><li><i>But</i> having good social skills confers life-long benefits. So, don't write them off. Get good at making a good first impression, being funny (if possible... this author still working on it...), speaking publicly.</li>
<li>Make things. Operating in a space with a lot of uncertainty is a very different experience to learning something.</li>
<li>More broadly, nobody is going to teach you to think for yourself. A large fraction of what people around you believe is mistaken. Internalize this and practice coming up with your own worldview. The correlation between it and those around you shouldn't be too strong unless you think you were especially lucky in your initial conditions.</li>
<li>If you're in the US and go to a good school, there are a lot of forces that will push you towards following traintracks laid by others rather than charting a course yourself. Make sure that the things you're pursuing are weird things that <i>you</i> want to pursue, not whatever the standard path is. Heuristic: do your friends at school think your path is a bit strange? If not, maybe it's too normal.</li>
<li>Figure out a way to travel to San Francisco and to meet other people who've moved there to pursue their dreams. Why San Francisco? San Francisco is the Schelling point for high-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Openness_to_experience">openness</a>, smart, energetic, optimistic people. Global Weird HQ. Take advantage of opportunities to travel to other places too, of course.</li>
<li>Find vivid examples of success in the domains you care about. If you want to become a great scientist, try to find ways to spend time with good (or, ideally, great) scientists in person. Watch YouTube videos of interviews. Follow some on Twitter.</li>
<li>People who did great things often did so at very surprisingly young ages. (They were grayhaired when they became famous... not when they did the work.) So, hurry up! You can do great things.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>If you're 20–30:</b> I don't know yet. I plan to think about this when I'm 35-40.</p>

<p>If advice on this page helped you, I'd love to <a href="mailto:patrick@collison.ie">hear about it</a>. And if you're reading this page, <a href="https://pioneer.app/r/patrickc/ucwvrbzy">Pioneer</a> and <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/emergentventures">Emergent Ventures</a> might be of interest. Alexey Guzey has some good <a href="https://guzey.com/personal/what-should-you-do-with-your-life/">suggestions and pointers</a>, too.</p>
