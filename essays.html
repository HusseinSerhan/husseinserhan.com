<h1>How can I use my ACL rehab to achieve near athlete levels of fitness?</h1>
<span class="byline">2025-09-07 <a href="/post/acl-rehab-fitness">permalink</a></span>

<h3>Should my ACL rehab be at the top of my priorities?</h3>
<p>Yes, pursuing an optimal recovery from my ACL surgery should be my primary aim for the rest of the year. First, an active lifestyle, including running and sports, is an important part of my long-term vision. Hence, solving for health problems have been at the top of my hierarchy of priorities for the past year. Second, after investing money, time and effort into the rehabilitation, failure to return to an active lifestyle would be demoralizing.</p>

<p>Hence, the importance of clarifying the end goal. Which is to achieve a level of mobility and strength that allows me to practice a diverse set of activities like running, cycling, golfing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and padel at the level of an active person by the Autumn of 2026.</p>

<h3>What obstacles and constraints do I have on my way to pursue an optimal rehab protocol?</h3>
<p>Given my full time job, the number one obstacle is time. However, I do have enough time to exercise in the morning before work and my days off. Money is the second constraint. Yet, the only expenses associated to my ACL rehab are my physio sessions ($92 each) and my peptides injections ($100 per vial).</p>

<h3>What do you mean by achieving near athlete levels of fitness?</h3>
<p>First, functionality, I want to get to a point where I am not afraid of practicing any sport at a reasonable level. Second, aesthetics, I want to achieve the proportions of a professional soccer player meaning slim, big shoulders, no belly, good development of quads, hamstrings and calves. And third, get the right habits in place to maintain near athlete levels of fitness until 60 years old.</p>

<h3>How are you going to manage the strength training component of your rehab?</h3>
<p>In terms of muscle groups, the focus is on strengthening the quads, hamstrings, calves, hips and trunk. Each muscle group should follow an individual progression. I found an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czx6LUnG1cs&t=647s">excellent Youtube video</a> that I followed to create my program.</p>
<h3>How are you going to manage the mobility component of your rehab?</h3>
<p>For mobility, the goal is daily stretching.</p>

<h3>How are you going to manage the use of peptides and physiotherapy throughout the rest of your rehab?</h3>
<p>I will keep my current protocol (a dose of 0.1 milliliters of BPC-157 and/or TB500 - 5 days per week) until the end of the year. Neither my physiotherapist or doctor report any effects. On the other hand, at week 18, most patients neglect physiotherapy. However, at this stage, 1 session every 2-4 weeks is recommended. Hence, my current protocol of 1 session every 3 weeks works well. As long as I don't stop physiotherapy, I should be on track for a successful recovery.</p>
