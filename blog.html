<h1>Where is Fintech Going? From PayPal's Early Days to Nubank's Hyperplane and Stripe's Bridge</h1>
<span class="byline">2024-02-13 <a href="/post/fintech-evolution">permalink</a></span>

<p>Growing up in Venezuela during periods of hyperinflation, I developed a firsthand understanding of financial system failures. Later, witnessing my family navigate the Lebanese banking crisis of 2021 further crystallized my interest in financial technology. These experiences have given me a unique perspective on fintech's evolution and its potential.</p>

<p>The fintech landscape has transformed dramatically since PayPal's inception in 1998. What began as a simple way to transfer money between Palm Pilots evolved into a crucial part of the early internet economy. Today, we're seeing a new wave of innovation that goes far beyond basic payment processing.</p>

<p>Three trends particularly stand out:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Infrastructure as a Product:</b> Stripe's Bridge represents a shift toward offering core banking infrastructure as a service, enabling companies to build sophisticated financial products without managing complex banking relationships.</li>
  
  <li><b>AI in Financial Services:</b> Nubank's Hyperplane project demonstrates how machine learning can transform credit scoring and risk assessment, particularly in markets where traditional credit data is scarce or unreliable.</li>
  
  <li><b>Global Financial Inclusion:</b> New platforms are emerging to serve the historically underbanked, leveraging mobile technology and alternative data sources to extend financial services to previously unreached populations.</li>
</ul>

<p>What's particularly interesting is how these developments address problems I witnessed firsthand. When Lebanon's banking system effectively collapsed, it highlighted the need for more resilient financial infrastructure. Similarly, Venezuela's hyperinflation demonstrated the importance of accessible, stable financial services.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I believe we're moving toward a more inclusive and efficient financial system. However, significant challenges remain, particularly around regulation, security, and accessibility. The next few years will be crucial in determining whether fintech can deliver on its promise of democratizing financial services.</p>
